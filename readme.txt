== Description ==
StayLogged is a WordPress plugin that automatically logs out users after any period of inactivity that you want, so you can keep users logged in for a shorter or longer time. 

== Installation ==

Upload the entire staylogged folder to the wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
Go to the Inactivity Logout Settings page under the Settings menu and adjust the logout time duration as desired.
== Usage ==
After installing and activating the StayLogged plugin, it will automatically log out users after the specified period of inactivity. The default timeout duration is 3600 seconds (1 hour), but you can adjust this on the Inactivity Logout Settings page.

== Why should I use such a thing? ==

There may be many reasons to do so! For example, imagine you're uploading a large file to your WordPress library. If you're inactive for too long, you'll be automatically logged out before the upload process finishes. This means you'll have to start the entire process from the beginning again. However, by using this plugin, you'll be able to extend the time session to whatever length you need.
